============================================================================================
Terminology:
ARP - L3 protocol used to build association of IP address and MAC address which allows for unicast packets
ARP Request - Type of ARP broadcast that enables a host to discover a particular MAC address knowing only the IP
ARP Response (Reply) - Type of ARP message that enables a host to respond to another host's ARP Request
Gratuitous ARP - Classified as an ARP response that is not replying to a request but is rather used to announce a host's IP and MAC address to the broadcast domain
Err-Disable - a state that Cisco uses for its switchports that violate a specific security configuration
Err-Disable Recovery - A global switch configuration on Cisco switches that enable one to tell Cisco to bring an err-disable switchport back online after a set amount of time following the violation
ARP Poisoning - An attack that takes advantage of the ARP protocol for MiTM attacks
IP ARP Inspection - Security configuration used by Cisco to prevent arp poisoning attacks by dropping ARP packets from MAC addresses whom do not have a matching DHCP snooping binding table entry
DHCP snooping - Security configuration used to block DHCP responses from unauthorized interfaces. Maintains a binding table of all MAC address/IP address pairs by capturing DHCP packets
IP ARP Inspection Rate Limit -- A security feature used to prevent an excess number of ARP reply's on a single interface. By default Cisco sets this to 15 and should be increased on modern networks
=============================================================================================
Configurations:

Arp inspection setup:

1. Configure ARP inspection rate limit:
int range gix/x-x/x
ip arp inspection limit rate # (between 0-2048 (default 15) )

2. Configure Global errdisable recovery:
errdisable recovery cause arp-inspection -- Enables global recovery from errdisable state
(Optional) errdisable recovery interval # (between 30-36400 seconds - default is 300)

3. Configure ARP Inspection Trusted interface(s):
int gix/x
ip arp inspection trust -- sets interface to trust arps received, crucial to set before enabling arp inspection, set on uplinks to any other switches
exit

4. Enable IP ARP Inspection:
ip arp inspection vlan #
